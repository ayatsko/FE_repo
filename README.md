This repository contains the data and R code to reproduce all analyses of our paper entitled "Why are trees hollow? Termites, microbes, and tree internal stem damage in a tropical savanna". In this study we determine how microbes and termites contribute to internal stem damage in savanna trees. We quantify vertical variation in damage, total amount of damaged biomass and species-level differences, and the co-occurence of microbial and termite players utilizing internal wood resources.

All code is inside the R directory.
